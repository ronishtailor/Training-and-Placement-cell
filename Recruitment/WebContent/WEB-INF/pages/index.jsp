					Recruitment Portal plays a crucial role in locating job opportunities for Under Graduates and Post Graduates passing out from the colleges by keeping in touch with reputed firms and industrial establishments. The portal operates round the year to facilitate contacts between companies and graduates. The number of students placed through the campus interviews might be less but On invitation, many reputed industries provides facilities to conduct interviews.
